This is just a little REST api for pots and potters. It came out of an idea to build a website for selling second hand pots, distinct from ebay and other on-line stores.

What it has turned into is a small project to learn some ASP.NET and up-to-date software practices.  So using Controllers for the rest bit, interfacing with MySQL, using NUnit for testing and Moq for mock objects.  It isn't perfect but it's the first I've done since 2008 (and probably longer since the later work at Active/Booking.com wasn't really tested that much.)
